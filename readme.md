# Pattern Maker

## What it does
A tool for creating patterns with a transparent background for making grids, graphs, borders, and patterns. The output is intended to be saved and then loaded into photoshop or gimp as a layer.

Pattern images are exported as PNG for transparency. 

## What it Is
This tool is created with HTML5 Canvases and takes advantage of converting canvaes into images and then downloading them locally. There are also various tools are created to support things like a rudimentary brush system.

There's no plan to support other formats than PNG because transparent backgrounds are assumed in the app. The app basically works by clearing and redrawing two canvases every frame.

## What's Next?
More tools like a line tool and a fill tool.
